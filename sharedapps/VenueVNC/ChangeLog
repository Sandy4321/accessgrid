1.0.2
  New .app file for registering with version 2.1.2 and higher.
    Use like this: RegisterApp.py -f VenueVNCClient.app
    (note when it copies vncviewer on linux, the executable
     flag needs to be set manually in ~/.AccessGrid/ShareApplications...)
  Changed keys with spaces in them.  The spaces prevent
    VenueServer from starting when loading persistent data.
    *** vnc users will need at least 1.0.2.

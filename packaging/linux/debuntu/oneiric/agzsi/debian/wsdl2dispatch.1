.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wsdl2dispatch
is a utility to generate a code skeleton from a WSDL file for a SOAP
server in Python, using ZSI. The programmer still has to implement the
HTTP server / request handler and the hooks to invoke the actual worker
methods. Note, however, that ZSI also includes ZSI.ServiceContainer
which implements the server functionality.

Description: A jabber library for Python
 The Bajjer library provides an API for dealing with
 XML streams. It provides SSL support using Python's
 socket.ssl or PyOpenSSL, and it provides the ability
 to set handlers, which call a callback function when
 a certain type of jabber packet is received.

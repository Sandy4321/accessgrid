# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pyxml: pyxml (python xml parser)
pyxml:
pyxml: This is the Python XML package.  The distribution contains a
pyxml: validating XML parser, an implementation of the SAX and DOM
pyxml: programming interfaces, an interface to the Expat parser (and the
pyxml: Expat parser itself), and a C helper module that can speed up
pyxml: xmllib.py by a factor of 5.  There's even documentation!

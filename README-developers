RUNNING FROM SOURCE OR CVS CHECKOUT


. Overview

Developers will want to run AccessGrid software directly from a source
tree instead of building entire packages and installing them each time.
You'll need to setup configuration files so you can test newly modified
code or a fresh cvs checkout without building an installation package.

To set up a configuration, run the bin/CvsSetup.py tool in either 
windows or linux.  It generates AccessGrid configuration files for
use with AccessGrid applications.


. A Simple Example

Here is a linux example of how to setup and run from a fresh cvs 
checkout.  There is very little difference on windows.

Before starting, you'll want to have the rat and vic packages installed.
You can download them from the accessgrid.org website -- on windows
they come with a standard AG2 installation.

To get the code, we'll checkout the files from cvs.  Instructions are here:
http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/fl/research/accessgrid/software/cvs/index.html
If you have already checked out a copy of the code, you can use that instead.
  > cvs co AccessGrid

Create a directory to hold the configuration files
  > mkdir cfg

Run the CvsSetup tool and specify the source and destination directories.
The checked out AccessGrid source is located in the "AccessGrid" directory.
  > python AccessGrid/bin/CvsSetup.py --agdir AccessGrid --dst cfg

Configuration files have now been created in the "cfg" directory.  Instructions
for setting your paths to use the new configuration are displayed.  You
can set AGTK_LOCATION, PYTHONPATH, and AGTK_INSTALL, or simply execute 
the appropriate script that was created:

  With bash or similar shell:
      >  . env-init.sh
  With csh or similar shell:
      >  source env-init.csh
  On Windows:
      >  env-init.bat

Do the final configuration step and configure video sources.
  > cd AccessGrid/bin
  > python SetupVideo.py

Now you should be able to run the VenueClient (personalNode mode shown).
  > python VenueClient.py --personalNode


. Notes on using Vic and Rat with AccessGrid source.

The vic and rat executables should be in the path if you want the AG 
software to use them.
  On Linux: If vic and rat packages are installed, they should already be in 
    your path, since they are placed in /usr/bin.
  On Windows: You can modify your PATH variable to find rat.exe, vic.exe, and
    related exe files, but it may be easier just to copy the rat and vic
    related executables into your AccessGrid/bin directory or another directory
    that is in your path.
    If modifying your path, make sure to copy the vic and rat executables away
    from a standard AG installation to refrain from putting other AccessGrid
    source files in your path.

    Tests text service and client

    TextServiceController - Starts text service 
    TextServiceClient - Has a text client and sends/receives text messages
   
    Several TextServiceClients are created and are sending messages in separate threads.
            
    In order to show correct result, we are waiting for all TextServiceClients to receive
    all text messages sent. The result shows sent and received messages in the order
    they got sent/received.

    ISSUES:
    * If the text service has shut down before the event clients have properly disconnected,
    an exception will be raised. Solution; use sleep to make sure they have exited.
    * If the text clients try to disconnect while still receiving text messages, an exception
    will be raised. Solution: wait to show result and shut down until all clients have received
    all messages.
    * If the send threads are started before the text clients have properly connected, some
    events might not get received. Solution; use sleep to make sure clients have connected.

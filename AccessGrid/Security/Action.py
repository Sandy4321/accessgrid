"""
Actions, as described in AGEP-0105.txt.

Actions are actions that can be authorized by the role based
authorization software. These actions can be anything, currently we
only use MethodActions, which provide a mechanism for authorizing
method invocation on services. There's no real limitation to what
actions can be or what they can be used for however.

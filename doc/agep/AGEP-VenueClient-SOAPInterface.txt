Abstract
========

This document proposes SOAP interfaces on the venue client for callers to query information about the current state.

Overview
========

Shared applications, service clients, and other software that runs alongside the venue client may have a dependency on the venue client state.  Since the venue client holds this state, it can be made available to other applications through a SOAP interface.  

Specifications
==============

The current venue client SOAP interface includes the following methods:

    EnterVenue(URL, back=0) : string (warningString)
    GetDataStoreInformation() : (uploadDescriptor,dataStoreUrl)
    GetDataDescriptions() : DataDescription list
    
    Methods to support lead/follow:
    
    RequestLead(followerProfile) : 
    LeadResponse(leaderProfile, isAuthorized) : 
    UnLead(followerProfile) : 
    RequestFollow(leaderProfile) : 
    FollowResponse(followerProfile, isAuthorized) : 

The following accessors will be added to retrieve the state:

    GetUsers() : ClientProfile list
    GetServices() : ServiceDescription list
    GetApplications() : ApplicationDescription list
    GetConnections() : ConnectionDescription list
    GetVenueURL() : string
    GetClientProfile() : ClientProfile
    GetNodeServiceURL() : string
    
No interfaces will be added to mutate the venue client state.


Security Issues
===============

* The VenueClient SOAP Server is used to support personal data stores (and follow/lead).  These additional interfaces will make much of the venue client state available to callers, too.

Interoperability Issues
=======================

The proposed changes are incremental, so will not affect the venue client interoperability.

Abstract
========

This enhancement provides a logging functionality that is abstracted
from the actual implementation. This means we can avoid requiring the
python logging module that is included in python 2.3 when we run on
python 2.2, and we can extend the logging factory to know about other
logging solutions like netLogger.

Overview
========

This enhancement creates a LogFactory class, and two logging classes,
PseudoLogger and the native python logger. The PseudoLogger is used
when running in the absence of the logginer module. By defining these
three classes we can hide the details of logging from the developers
and users.

- Module level logging
- Class level logging
- Usage level logging

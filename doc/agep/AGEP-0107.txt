Core Toolkit Design Changes for 2.1.3
=====================================
 
:version: $Revision: 1.2 $
:author: Ivan R. Judson <judson@mcs.anl.gov>
:status: Draft

Abstract
========

This document proposes design modifications to the existing Core Toolkit
Design to make it more solid, with a factoring that allows an
easier transition to GT3 or other network interfaces. It applies well
known patterns, leveraging the pattern terminology to keep the code as
clear as possible and also abstracts the persistence solution for the
venues.

Overview
========

There are a few reorganizations that can be done within the AG
module. These will result in a reasonably clean and simple set of
logical sub-modules with interfaces defined among them. The
separations that are proposed in this enhancement include:

1. Separating interfaces and implementations

  The proposed naming is for interfaces to have the name format:

  - **<Network Protocol><Class Name>I**, or
  - **<Network Protocol><Class Name>Interface**

  (e.g. SOAPVenueServerI or SOAPVenueServerInterface)
  then the Venue Server implementation can retain the name
  VenueServer. This allows the creation of many interfaces with clear
  naming, for the same implementation object and the additional syntax
  is retained where it is needed for clarification.

2. Creating a SOAP interface base class with two methods:

  - a constructor that registers the implementation with interface and
    the interface with the implementation, and 
  - an authorization method that is used by default, the proposed
    policy is that the default authorization method disallow incoming
    actions.
 
3. Move AppDatabase from Toolkit to VenueClient
   [Done]
  
  This is the appropriate place for it to go.

4. Update to latest version of pyGlobus
5. Update to GT2.4.3 on Linux, Mac OS X
6. Update to GT2.4.3+ on Windows
  
  Updating these pieces of software should make it easier for us to
  maintain, and it will make it easier to migrate in the future.

Specifications
==============

__init__.py

  __hostingImpl = "SOAPpy"

  def GetHostingImpl():

  def SetHostingImpl():

  def ListHostingImpls():
    
SOAPInterface.py:

  class InvalidURL(Exception)

  class ConnectionFailed(Exception)

  class SOAPInterface:

    def __init__(self, impl):

    def _authorize(self, *args, **kw):

    def _GetMethodActions(self):

    def IsValid(self):

    _IsValid = IsValid

  class SOAPIWrapper:

    def __init__(self, url):

    def IsValid(self):

    _IsValid = IsValid

  SOAPpy/
    
    Client.py
    
      class Handle

        def __init__(self, url):
        
        def GetUrl(self):

        def GetProxy(self):

        def __repr__(self):
       

   Server.py
      
      class Server
      
        def __init__(self, addr, server):

        def IsRunning(self)

        def Run(self):

        def RunInThread(self):

        def Stop(self):

        def GetPort(self):

        def GetURLBase(self):

        def RegisterObject(self, object, namespace = '', path = ''):

        def UnregisterObject(self, object):

        def FindObject(self, obj):
        
        def GetURLForObject(self, obj):

        def FindObjectForURL(self, url):

        def FindObjectForPath(self, path):

     class SecureServer(Server)

        def __init__(self, addr, debug = 0)

     class InsecureServer(Server)

        def __init__(self, addr, debug = 0)

VenueServer

  in the __init__ method, this object creates a SOAPVenueServerI object 
  passing self. This effectively creates a single SOAP interface 
  (self.interface), later when we support multiple interfaces per object this
  should be removed and replaced with self.interfaces = list() and 
  AddInterface(self, interface).

  The server also has a authorize(subject, actionName) that exposes the
  mechanism for the SOAP layer to do authorization.

Venue

  in the __init__ method, this object creates a SOAPVenueI object 
  passing self. This effectively creates a single SOAP interface 
  (self.interface), later when we support multiple interfaces per object this
  should be removed and replaced with self.interfaces = list() and 
  AddInterface(self, interface).

  The venue also has a authorize(subject, actionName) that exposes the
  mechanism for the SOAP layer to do authorization.

Security Issues
===============

This modification makes no change to the underlying security solution,
however it does provide new hooks for the completed authorization
layer described elsewhere.

Interoperability Issues
=======================

The refactoring in this proposal should not affect the
interoperability of the client with servers and services. This is an
internal refactoring.

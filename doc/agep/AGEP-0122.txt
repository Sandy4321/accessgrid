Abstract
========

This document proposes a scheme for integrating service certificates into the toolkit.  The goal is to enable users to configure services to run with a particular service certificate, possibly at boot.

Overview
========

The toolkit currently supports identity certificates.  For the average user running the venue client, an identity certificate often suffices.  However, users of the service-oriented portions of the toolkit--VenueServer, NodeService, ServiceManager, and BridgeServer--want to be able to use no-password service certificates to avoid proxy timeouts, and to enable the services to be run at boot without needing to generate a proxy.

User scenario
-------------

Certificate Request
'''''''''''''''''''
The user will need a service certificate.  This will happen through the existing ceritificate request mechanism:

- Request service certificate
- Retrieve service certificate

Service Configuration
'''''''''''''''''''''

- Select a service and service certificate
- Run at boot? Become root to create startup scripts
- Run now? Launch service with new profile
- Run from command line? Specify profile on command line


Summary of Modifications
========================

Certificate Management
''''''''''''''''''''''

- Modify certificate management to tag service certificates in repository
  by type
  
- The CertMgmt UI should allow users to view service 
  certificates in a separate panel, and not mix them with identity
  certs

Install
'''''''

- Create directory for storing service profiles
    UserConfigDir/ServiceProfiles

Service Configuration Tool
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- Define Service Profile format

    [ServiceProfile]
    service = VenueServer|AGNodeService|AGServiceManager|BridgeServer
    credential = Cred
    
    [Cred]
    type = x509
    cert = ?
    
    How to specify the credential in the service profile?  Ideally, this
    would be simple enough that the user could construct the service
    profile independently.
    
    - cert/key file locations
    - hash into cert repository (ick)
    - DN (requires search across repository)
    
- Create Service Configuration UI

    - Allow user to select a service and certificate
        - Tool should require matching of service to service
          certificate (VenueServers should use VenueServer certs)
    - [Optional] Integrate cert req tool to enable service cert 
      requests from within tool (either at implementation or 
      system call level)
    - Write service profile to ServiceProfiles directory

- Create startup scripts

    - Support becoming administrator to install service
    - Command-line option for profile name accepts argument 
      that matches file in the ServiceProfiles directory
      
- Tool could accept a '--profile' argument to modify an existing
  service profile

Toolkit.Service
'''''''''''''''

- Add command-line argument to specify profile (--profile)

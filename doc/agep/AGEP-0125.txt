Abstract

Overview
========

This revision of the node service infrastructure aims to reach the goals we initially set out:

- Ease of configuration
- Ease of operation
- Node automation
- Performance improvements

These goals will be fulfilled through the following tasks:

- Run node components as services (init.d on linux, services on windows)
- Make node components discoverable on the network (Rendezvous)
- Enable services to discover and communicate with each other
- Enable services to be imported and run in-process to eliminate SOAP calls
    in addition to current execution of services
- Executed processes should call back to service manager upon starting
    instead of waiting for the service manager to contact them
- Provide headless video capture tool (OpenMash)
    - Need network control interface
- Provide headless audio tool
    - Need network control interface (pyMbus)
- Provide necessary hooks for development of operator panel
- Push resource discovery down to services, and aggregate with core resources discovered by service manager
- Allow services to include a custom client and register it via mimetypes
- Track execution of services (restart?)
- Need more exception info returned through SOAP calls
- Allow secure/insecure communications between components

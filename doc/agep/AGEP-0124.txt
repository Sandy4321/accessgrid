AG1 to AG2 Transitional Plan
============================

Overview

This document describes the plan to transition the Access Grid infrastructure away from the AG1 software
to the AG2 software. Since there is a large user community using the Access Grid software, this must be
carefully done so as to not disable users from getting their work done.

The transition plan to move AG1 users to AG2 is:
	- To migrate the community to the latest reliable software
	- Scheduled to coincide with university summer schedules
	- To ease the support load on the AG Dev Team
	- Sufficiently long to enable all AG1 Users to find appropriate time to transition
	- Supported by more formal weekly test sessions.

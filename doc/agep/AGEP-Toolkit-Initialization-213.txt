Abstract
========

This AGEP describes a proposed factoring of the initialization code
for the AGTk. The goal is to unify and clarify the process of
initialization for anything that is developed using the AGTk.

Overview
========

In order to unify and clarify the initialization process there are a
few activities that need to be done by every piece of Access Grid
related software. These activities are enumerated, described, and a
factoring is presented that encapsulates them into a well defined set
of interfaces.

The basic activities that are done during initialization are:

- Command Line Parsing
- Logging/Debugging Setup
- Toolkit Environment Verification
- Security Environment Verification
  - Globus Initialization
- Configuration Processing      
  - Looking for system wide configs and either referencing or copying them

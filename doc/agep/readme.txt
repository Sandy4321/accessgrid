AGEP  [ Access Grid Enhancement Proposal ]  README

AGEPs are design documents for the Access Grid Toolkit.  They can either provide information about the toolkit or propose modifications to it.

AGEPs provide a method for new features and designs to be proposed.  They also contain the responses and design decisions associated with each proposal.  Revisions to documents are kept in CVS which provides us with a full revision history.

An AGEP for new features often contains an implementation of the proposed changes.  Modifications may or may not be eventually added to the core toolkit.  Just because a modification is not included in the core does not mean it cannot be made available separately. 

Format:  A template for the format is in template.txt.  AGEPs are text documents.  This allows us to keep a revision history in CVS.

Naming: To be determined.

Numbering: An AGEP is assigned a number when it is first distributed.  Until an automated system is established, an AGEP number can be obtained from the AGEP maintainers.

Feedback: Responses and discussion on AGEPs should be sent to the author(s) and to relevant mailing lists.

Origins:  The AGEP is based on Python's PEP document process.

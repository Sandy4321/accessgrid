This readme is to keep anybody who's using cvs access to the AGTk
documents informed about what's going on and how it works. It might be
considered the AGTk Document How-To at somepoint.

Document Types
---------------

Architecture Documents - Describe the problem, concepts and
	     requirements driving a part of the system.

Design Documents - Describes the goals and constraints of a particular
       implementation and version of a part of the system. Includes
       specifications of the solution.

How-To Documents - Shorter documents that describe how to do something
       specific in or with the toolkit.

Implementation Notes - Documents capturing details of the
       implementation of a design that are important for other developers and
       maintainers to be familiar with.

Manuals - Pretty self explanatory.

Tools and Formatting
---------------------

The AGTk effort is using Microsoft Word and Visio for doing
documentation. These are used to author and maintain the documents,
however we do output other formats (html and pdf).

Starting New Documents
-----------------------

In this directory there should be a Outline and Template for each type
of document described above. Currently, we have an outline and
template for design documents.

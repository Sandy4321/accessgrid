OVERVIEW OF THE ACCESS GRID TOOLKIT

The Access Grid Toolkit (AGTk) provides users, developers, and service
providers with the software components required to explore next
generation collaborative environments.

Please review the license on the software found in the file COPYING.txt.

. For Users

Users of the Access Grid seeking to collaborate can share audio, video
and text with the basic toolkit. The experience is much like
traditional videoconferencing except that it's multipoint, multistream
video, with hands-free, echo-free, full-duplex audio. Additionally,
the basic AGTk provides data sharing mechanisms for users to store
data in the Virtual Venue, and to share applications using mechanisms
provided by the Venue Server, including shared presentation viewing
and shared web browsing.


. For Developers

Developers wishing to contribute to the Access Grid Project or the
Access Grid Toolkit should get familiar with the source code and the
tools, and then decide what part of the AGTk to work on.  Developer
documentation is available at:

http://www.mcs.anl.gov/fl/research/accessgrid/software/developer.html

Also, the ag-dev mailing list is a great place to discuss development
work.  Subscription information is online here:

http://www.mcs.anl.gov/fl/research/accessgrid/about/maillist.html


. For Service Providers

Individuals wishing to provide AGTk Services, should first host some
Virtual Venues through a Virtual Venue Server.

OVERVIEW OF THE ACCESS GRID TOOLKIT

The Access Grid Toolkit (AGTk) provides users, developers, and service
providers with the software components required to explore next
generation collaborative environments.

Please review the license on the software found in the file COPYING.txt.

. For Users

Users of the Access Grid seeking to collaborate can share audio, video
and text with the basic toolkit. The experience is much like
traditional videoconferencing except that it's multipoint, multistream
video, with hands-free, echo-free, full-duplex audio. Additionally,
the basic AGTk provides data sharing mechanisms for users to either
put data into the Virtual Venue, or carry it around with them on their
Workspace Dock. All of the audio, video, text, and file transfer are
done via standards based GSI/OpenSSL communication.

. For Developers

Developers wishing to contribute to the Access Grid Project or the
Access Grid Toolkit should get familiar with the source code and the
tools (pyGlobus, GT2.X), and then decide what part of the AGTk to work
on. Information on where to contribute to the development can be found
at http://www.mcs.anl.gov/fl/research/accessgrid/developers/areas.htm.

. For Service Providers

Individuals wishing to provide AGTk Services, should first host some
Virtual Venues through a Virtual Venue Server. Information on how to
run a Virtual Venue Server can be found in the INSTALL file.
